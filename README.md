Dataset Preparation
Uncompress the datasets if not already done and place them in the same folder as the code files.
Remove the first few comment lines before giving them as input to the code files.
Make sure the datasets exactly match the given file names while editing in the main method of the given codes.
The datasets are attached in the given links below :
as-caida.txt (Link)
as20000102.txt (Link )
CA-HepTh.txt (Link)
netscience.txt (Link)
Execution Instruction
Before executing the code, please go to the main method of the respective file and change it to the required dataset's path.
To execute Exact algorithm (Algo-1) in the paper "Efficient Algorithms for Densest Subgraph Discovery" , run the command :
g++ 1-Exact.cpp -O3 -o 1 && ./1
To execute CoreExact algorithm (Algo-4) code in the paper "Efficient Algorithms for Densest Subgraph Discovery", run the command :
g++ 2-CoreExact.cpp -O3 -o 2 && ./2
